# Python_Graph_Traversal
Contains all the code for my implementation of the graph traversal content in COSC262
- BFS: Breadth-First Search implementation (contains bfs_tree, and bfs_loop)
- DFS: Depth-First Search implementation (contains dfs_tree, and dfs_loop)
- adjacency_list: Turns a textual representation into an adjacency list
- adjacency_matrix: Turns a textual representation into an adjacency matrix
- backtracking: Uses depth-first backtracking to solve problems (contains dfs_backtracking, add_to_output, should_prune, is_solution, children, permutations, all_paths), permutations and all_paths are uses of the backtracking functions
- dijkstra: Implementation of Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm (contains dijkstra, next_vertex)
- floyd_warshall: Implementation of the Floyd-Warshall All-Pairs Shortest-Path algorithm
- is_strongly_connected: Determines if a graph is strongly-connected using dfs-search
- prim - Implementation of Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm (contains prim, next_vertex)
- transpose - Returns the transpose of an adjacency list
